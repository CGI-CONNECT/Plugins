CONNECT-NHINAdapterService
==========================

NHIN Adapter Service

The Dynamic Document generation components were generated by Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) and Northrop Group Corporation in support of the DoD/VLER Phase 1a Pilot demonstration. The FHA has taken this contribution and incorporated the Dynamic Document generation portion into CONNECT.

CONNECT supported Release Version:

CONNECT 2.4 and CONNECT 3.0

The following Endpoints in ConnectionInfo file should be updated with dynamic document AdapterDocQuery and AdapterDocRetrieve endpoints. The DocRegistry and DocRepository should also be updated to dynamic document docRegistry and docRepository endpoints as shown below. The dynamic Document Query/ Document Retrieve service will be implemented if the endpoint is provided in ConnectionInfo files. The Document Query service makes call to Dynamic Document assembler (Adapter Document Assembly) and assembles the document. The DocRegistry and DocRepository services are implemented by AdapterDocumentRepository Modules whereas DocumentManager Module provides operations to do Store/Retrieve/Archive/ArchiveQuery of dynamic documents.
