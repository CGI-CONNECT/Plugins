CONNECT-AdapterMpi
==================

Adapter MPI

The Dynamic Document generation components were generated by Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) and Northrop Group Corporation in support of the DoD/VLER Phase 1a Pilot demonstration. The FHA has taken this contribution and incorporated the Dynamic Document generation portion into CONNECT.

CONNECT supported Release Version:

CONNECT 2.4 and CONNECT 3.0

The AdapterComponentMPI implements the MPI and returns the Patient demographics is the Patient is found. The AdapterComponnetMPI only implements FindPatients query.
